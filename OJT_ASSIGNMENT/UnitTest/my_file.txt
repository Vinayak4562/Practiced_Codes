Hi this is vinayak.
In this example, the lambda function lambda x: x[1] extracts the second element (index 1) from each tuple for sorting.

While lambda functions are useful for simple tasks, 
they are limited in their capabilities compared to regular named functions 
defined with def. Lambda functions are best suited for concise operations 
and not for complex or lengthy functions.
