==================================================
This function uses the calendar module to determine the number of days in the given month and to check the day of the week for each date in the month.

The monthrange() function is used to get the number of days in the given month and year. This function returns a tuple of two values: the first value is the day of the week on which the month starts (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc.), and the second value is the number of days in the month.

The function then loops over all the days in the month and checks the day of the week using the weekday() function from the calendar module. If the day is a Saturday (represented by the calendar.SATURDAY constant), the day is added to the saturdays list.

Finally, the function returns the list of Saturdays.
=====================================
Note: The function assumes that the month and year arguments are integers, and that the month is between 1 (January) and 12 (December). If the arguments are invalid, the function may raise exceptions.
