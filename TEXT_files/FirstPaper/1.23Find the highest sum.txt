22.Find the highest sum of the string by removing the duplicates for each iteration
input=’1211’

To find the highest sum of the string by removing the duplicates for each iteration, we need to follow these steps:

Initialize a variable to store the sum of the numbers in the string.
Loop through each character in the string.
If the current character is not equal to the previous character, add its numeric value to the sum.
Return the sum.
Here's the Python code to implement this algorithm:

def highest_sum(s):
    prev_char = ''
    sum = 0
    for c in s:
        if c != prev_char:
            sum += int(c)
            prev_char = c
    return sum
Let's test this function with the input '1211':

>>> 2
3

The first iteration of the loop adds the first '1' to the sum, and the second iteration adds the '2'. On the third iteration, '1' is skipped because it is a duplicate of the previous character, and the final '1' is added to the sum.

Therefore, the highest sum of the string '1211' by removing duplicates for each iteration is 3.
