1. What are the differences between list and tuple? Which is faster and why?
2. What is the lambda function in python? Explain with examples.
3. What is monkey patching and what is the use of monkey patch?
4. What is the importance of PEP rules
5. Can we order a dictionary? How?
6. Write a python program to right rotate a List by n
Enter position to rotate list item: 3
Sample input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
Expected output: [50, 60, 70, 10, 20, 30, 40]
7. Difference between append and extend operations of list
8. Create a dictionary where the key is an even number from the given list and the value
will be the occurrence of that element in the list. input= [1,2,3,2,4,2,4,7,8,4,5,8,6,9,2]
9. Write a function swap_element that contains two args which will be the position of
elements present in the list. The function must swap the elements present in those
positions.
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] function: swap_element(arg1, arg2)
10. Write the output of the program:
match = ‘version’, input=’Upgraded_image_version_8.0.4.3’
if match in input:
print(‘YES’)
else:
print(‘NO’)
11. Rewrite the program to get proper output
Match = 'version'
input=8
print(Match+input)
12. How is memory management done in python?
13. When do you use generators in python? Give an example
14. Give the scenarios, when you will get ‘ValueError’
15. Write a program to multiply two given number without using “*” operation and any in built
function
16. Write a program to find the count of alphabet alone in the given alphanumeric string for
Ex1: input=’abb24ccc8ddbbca1’ output=’a1b224c3d2b2c1a11’
Ex2: input = ‘abc23’ output=’a1b1c123’
