Write a method number_of_prime_numbers() which takes two input arguments num1 and num2 and should return the total number of prime numbers in the range. The numbers num1 and num2 are inclusive of the range. Also add all the numbers in an empty list and return the sum of the list. So finally your function will return two things, first will be the count of prime numbers and the other will be the sum of all the prime numbers in the given range.

def number_of_prime_numbers(num1, num2):
    prime_count = 0                                 # Initialize count to zero
    prime_sum = 0                                   # Initialize sum to zero
    primes = []
    
    for num in range(num1, num2+1):                 # Iterate over the range of numbers from num1 to num2, inclusive
        if num > 1:                                 # Bcz 1 is not a prime number so we have to skip 1 using condition num > 1              
            
            for i in range(2, int(num/2)+1):        # num/2 will give Float val so we have to convert it in to integer         
                if num % i == 0:                    # if number is divisible by i then its a not a prime number we will break the loop
                    break
            else:
                primes.append(num)                  # appending the prime number to the primes list
                prime_count += 1                    # incrementing the prime number count
                prime_sum += num                    # adding the prime number to the primes_sum

    print("Prime numbers in a given range: ", primes)   # printing all prime numumbers in given range
    return prime_count, prime_sum                       # returning both values i,e.. prime_count and prime_sum 


count, prime_sum = number_of_prime_numbers(10,20)

print("Count of prime numbers:", count)
print("Sum of prime numbers:", prime_sum)
