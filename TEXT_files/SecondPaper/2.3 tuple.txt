Given a tuple (“Msys”, “Technologies”, “2007”), add “Python” at the end of this tuple and the
output should also be in the form of tuple. Make a note that tuples are immutable in nature so you
need to find some idea to make modification and print the updated tuple.
Yes, you are correct that tuples are immutable in nature, so we cannot modify them directly. However, we can create a new tuple that contains the elements of the original tuple as well as the new element "Python". Here's an example program in Python to add "Python" at the end of a given tuple:

given_tuple = ("Msys", "Technologies", "2007")   # Given tuple

new_tuple = given_tuple + ("Python",)            # create a new tuple by concatenating the original tuple with a tuple containing "Python"


print("The updated tuple is:", new_tuple)           # to print the new tuple
print(type(new_tuple))                              # to print the type of new tuple

In this program, we create the original tuple original_tuple containing three elements: "Msys", "Technologies", and "2007". We then create a new tuple new_tuple by concatenating the original_tuple with a tuple containing a single element "Python". Note that we need to add a comma after "Python" to create a tuple with a single element, otherwise it will be interpreted as a string. Finally, we print the new_tuple containing all the elements of the original_tuple plus "Python" at the end.
