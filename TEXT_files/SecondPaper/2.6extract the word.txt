Write a program to extract the words starting with lowercase letter present in the list. [‘Nissan’,
‘maruti’, ‘hyundai’, ‘Volkswagen’, ‘audi’]
Sure, here's an example program in Python to extract the words starting with lowercase letter present in the list:

list = ['Nissan', 'maruti', 'hyundai', 'Volkswagen', 'audi']     # create the list
list1 = []
for i in list:                                                  # To iterate a list
    if i[0].islower():                                          # to chek the word statrs from lower case or not
        list1.append(i)                                         # if its lowercase append it in to list1
print("The words starting with lowercase letter are:", list1)   # to print the list1
 

# # extract the words starting with lowercase letter using a list comprehension

# list = ['Nissan', 'maruti', 'hyundai', 'Volkswagen', 'audi']     # create the list

# result = [i for i in list if i[0].islower()]            # extract the words starting with lowercase letter using a list comprehension

# print("The words starting with lowercase letter are:", result)  # print the result


In this program, we create the list lst containing five words. We then use a list comprehension to extract the words starting with lowercase letter from the list. The list comprehension iterates over each word in the list, and checks whether the first character of the word is lowercase using the islower() method. If the first character is lowercase, the word is added to the result list using the append() method. Finally, we print the result list using the print() function. This produces a list of all the words starting with lowercase letter present in the original list.
