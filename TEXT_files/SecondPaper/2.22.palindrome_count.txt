22.Find the palindrome words with the count value from the given string.Output should be in
form of dict. key will be palidrome word and value will be number of occurence.
i/p given a string - Nittin & his mom went to a park last friday. His Mom observed that the weather was too cool. Nittin also met his sis. If we reverse the number 1331 then we also get 1331.
o/p - {'nittin': 2, 'mom': 2, 'sis': 1, '1331': 2}
